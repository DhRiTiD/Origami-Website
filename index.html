                <p>Cicadas, very unique insects that enter our lawn and <br> make shrieking, buzzing sounds during a hot summer <br>day.
                    <br> Did you know, they improve lawns by digging tunnels that <br> allow air into the soil. When they die, their rotting bodies <br> put nitrogen into the soil.
                    <br> Well, if you want a buzzzzing bug in your lawn, you sure <br>must try folding a piece of paper into a little cicada <br>for your lawn. <br>

                <p>What's more enjoyable than watching a giant panda doing <br> stupid little things for fun! Panda's are big eaters <br> and love to chop bamboos.
                    Have you known that pandas don't <br>hibernate during winters like other bears, thay just change<br>  their comfort zone.

                <p>Pigeons occur worldwide except in the coldest regions <br> and the most remote islands. Pigeons are incredibly <br>
                     complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a <br> small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a <br> test of 
                     self recognition.<br>
