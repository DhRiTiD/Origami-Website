                <p>Cicadas, very unique insects that enter our lawn and <br> make shrieking, buzzing sounds during a hot summer <br>day.
                    <br> Did you know, they improve lawns by digging tunnels that <br> allow air into the soil. When they die, their rotting bodies <br> put nitrogen into the soil.
                    <br> Well, if you want a buzzzzing bug in your lawn, you sure <br>must try folding a piece of paper into a little cicada <br>for your lawn. <br>
